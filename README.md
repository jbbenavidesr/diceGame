# Dice game

This game is just a simple 2 player game where both players take turns to throw
the dice and they add the value to their score. The first player to get to 20 wins
(they both should have the same number of throws for it to be fair, giving place
to a possible tie).

The idea is for it to be a very simple game that allow me to explore different
aspects of doing a game in the Browser with vanilla JS.

## Things to learn

The objective is to take my actual knowledge of JS to the limit. This game doesn't
require a very complex logic, but it requires me to think through how to go from
ideas to the game. 

I'll work it from scratch, meaning that I will have to design the game interface.
It'll probably be similar to the one they use in the original module at Scrimba,
but I will still do it from scratch.

Finally, I hope to learn a little of animations to make the rolling nicer and a 
little on how to make the game accesible and performant. For this part, I'll ask
for help once I have a working version to some people that really know their thing
of a11ty.


## Acknowledgements

This game was taken as a project from the frontend Path at [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com).
They have it as a module in the path however, instead of coding along I decide to
binge all the module and then implement it by myself from scratch.
